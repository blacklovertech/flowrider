FLow Rider Technologies — FounderX Competition Deliverables

1. Primary Market Research (PMR) Plan

Objective: Validate that dedicated, well-compensated rider-employees significantly outperform the gig model on reliability, cost-efficiency, and service quality.

Methodology: Mixed-Methods Approach

Quantitative Survey (150+ Riders - Bengaluru & Delhi-NCR)
- Current average earnings (₹/day), weekly fuel/maintenance costs
- Preferred delivery categories, platform satisfaction (1-10 scale)
- Desire for stable salary vs. variable pay, interest in upskilling

Qualitative Interviews
- 10-15 Operations Managers (Q-Commerce & Food Delivery): Rider attrition rates, training costs, delayed orders percentage, premium service willingness
- 20 Top-Tier Riders: Efficiency factors, employee model incentives

Expected Insights
- Quantification of the "reliability tax" platforms currently pay
- Optimal base salary + incentive model data
- Validation of rider preferences (area avoidance, category preferences)

2. Secondary Market Research (SMR) Synopsis

Key Industry Findings
- Market Size: Indian last-mile delivery projected at $6-7Bn by 2024 (Q-Commerce CAGR: 25-30%)
- The Gig Problem: 7.7M+ gig workers with 50%+ annual turnover (2023 NITI Aayog)
- Cost of Attrition: ₹3,000-₹5,000 per rider replacement (recruitment, training, verification)
- Efficiency Gap: Top riders: 35-40 deliveries/shift vs. average: 15-20 deliveries

SuperFleet Conclusion: Large, growing market with broken, expensive labor model. Our employee model converts variable, unreliable expenses into predictable, high-performance service.

9. Working MVP & Full Code Strategy (24-Hour Focus)

Objective: Demonstrate intelligent allocation logic, not full-scale product.

Tech Stack
- Backend: Node.js/Express
- Frontend: React (Vite)
- Database: In-memory JSON for demo (replace with MongoDB/SQLite later)
- Maps: Mock map (Leaflet/Google Maps can be added)

Core Function (Allocation Engine)

```javascript
function assignRider(order) {
  const availableRiders = getRidersNearLocation(order.pickup, 3);
  const filteredRiders = availableRiders.filter((rider) =>
    rider.preferences.includes(order.category) &&
    rider.currentLoad < rider.maxCapacity
  );
  const bestRider = filteredRiders.sort((a, b) => a.distance - b.distance)[0];
  return bestRider;
}
```

Demo Flow
1. Pre-load JSON with 10 mock riders (id, name, coordinates, preferences)
2. POST to /api/order with mock order data
3. Backend runs assignRider function, returns rider details
4. React dashboard shows assignment on map (rider + order markers)
